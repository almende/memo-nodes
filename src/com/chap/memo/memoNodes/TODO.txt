-Sorting feature in "Algorithm"  (Pre-topx?)
-Speed enhancements:
	-keeping Nodes in memory more effectively
	-Get Nodes into memory more effectively, more heuristics, better clustering, better indexes
	-Keeping memory within the Nodes more coherent in memory (by encoding all fields in one byte array);
	(As Nodes are immutable, is there no compiler annotation that tells Java to keep all elements together?)
-JSON import for Nodes/Arcs (bulk creation)
